Genesis
=======

Genesis is a shoot'em up game (side-scrolling) designed to teach the 
basics of python, programming, and game design.

The art of the game was shamelessly stolen from the Internet, and were 
sitting around my disk for a while. As such, I don't have a clue where 
I found, or who created them. I'll do my best to find the authors and 
give proper credits. They do really deserve it.
